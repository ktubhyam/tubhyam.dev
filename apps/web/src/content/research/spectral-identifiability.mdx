abstract: "We present a group-theoretic and information-theoretic framework for bounding what vibrational spectra can reveal about molecular structure. Using representation theory, we define the Information Completeness Ratio R(G,N) that quantifies the fraction of vibrational degrees of freedom observable via IR and Raman spectroscopy for molecules with point group G and N atoms. We prove that for centrosymmetric molecules, IR and Raman provide complementary (non-overlapping) vibrational information, and conjecture — with strong numerical evidence from Jacobian rank analysis on 999 QM9 molecules — that the combined forward map is generically injective up to symmetry equivalence."

## Motivation

Can you reconstruct a molecule from its vibrational spectrum? This is the spectroscopic inverse problem — and it's the theoretical foundation underlying [Spektron](/projects/spektron)'s architecture design. Before building a model to solve the inverse problem, we need to understand what information is theoretically available.

Not all molecular vibrations produce spectral signatures. Symmetry dictates which modes are IR-active (dipole moment changes), which are Raman-active (polarizability changes), and which are silent. This paper quantifies exactly how much information is observable for any molecular symmetry.

## Key Contributions

### 1. Information Completeness Ratio

We define $R(G, N)$ as the fraction of vibrational degrees of freedom observable via combined IR and Raman spectroscopy for a molecule with point group $G$ and $N$ atoms:

$$R(G, N) = \frac{N_\text{IR} + N_\text{Raman} - N_\text{coincident}}{3N - 6}$$

where $N_\text{IR}$ and $N_\text{Raman}$ are the number of IR-active and Raman-active modes respectively, and $N_\text{coincident}$ counts modes active in both. The denominator $3N - 6$ is the total number of vibrational degrees of freedom (for nonlinear molecules).

$R(G,N) = 1$ means every vibrational mode produces at least one spectral signature — no information is lost to symmetry. $R(G,N) < 1$ means some modes are completely silent in both IR and Raman, creating a fundamental information gap that no model can overcome.

### 2. Modal Complementarity Theorem

For centrosymmetric molecules (those with an inversion center, point groups $C_i$, $C_{2h}$, $D_{2h}$, $O_h$, etc.), the **mutual exclusion principle** holds rigorously:

**Theorem (Modal Complementarity):** If $G$ contains the inversion operation $i$, then a normal mode is either IR-active or Raman-active, but never both. That is, the IR-active and Raman-active mode sets are disjoint.

This means combined IR + Raman spectroscopy provides strictly more information than either technique alone for centrosymmetric molecules. The proof follows from the character of the inversion operation: IR activity requires odd symmetry ($\chi(i) = -1$) while Raman activity requires even symmetry ($\chi(i) = +1$) under the relevant representation.

For non-centrosymmetric molecules (most organic molecules, including the QM9 dataset), modes can be simultaneously IR and Raman active — the complementarity is partial rather than strict.

### 3. Generic Identifiability Conjecture

**Conjecture:** For molecules with $R(G,N) = 1$ and sufficiently many atoms ($N \geq 4$), the combined forward map $\phi_\text{IR+Raman}: \mathcal{F} \to \mathcal{S}$ from force constants to spectral observables is generically injective up to symmetry equivalence.

In other words: if all modes are observable, the combined spectrum uniquely determines the molecular force field (and hence geometry) for almost all molecules. "Generically" means except on a measure-zero set of pathological cases.

## Theoretical Framework

### The Forward Map

The forward map from molecular structure to vibrational spectrum is determined by the **Wilson GF method**:

$$\det(\mathbf{GF} - \lambda \mathbf{I}) = 0$$

where $\mathbf{G}$ is the kinetic energy matrix (determined by atomic masses and geometry), $\mathbf{F}$ is the force constant matrix (determined by the potential energy surface), and the eigenvalues $\lambda_k = 4\pi^2 \nu_k^2$ give the vibrational frequencies.

This map is $G$-equivariant: symmetry-equivalent molecular structures produce identical spectra. Our framework characterizes the fiber structure of this map — how many distinct structures map to the same spectrum.

### Symmetry Quotient

**Theorem (Symmetry Quotient):** The dimension of the observable spectral space for point group $G$ is:

$$\dim(\mathcal{S}_G) = \sum_{\Gamma \in \text{IR-active}} n_\Gamma + \sum_{\Gamma \in \text{Raman-active}} n_\Gamma$$

where $n_\Gamma$ is the number of times irreducible representation $\Gamma$ appears in the vibrational representation. This sum equals $R(G,N) \cdot (3N-6)$.

### Fano Inequality Bound

Using Fano's inequality from information theory, we derive a lower bound on the identification error for any spectroscopic method:

$$P_e \geq 1 - \frac{I(\text{spectrum}; \text{structure}) + 1}{\log_2 |\mathcal{M}|}$$

where $|\mathcal{M}|$ is the number of candidate molecules and $I$ is the mutual information. For molecules with $R(G,N) < 1$, the silent modes create a hard information-theoretic ceiling on identification accuracy that no model — however powerful — can exceed.

## Computational Evidence

### QM9 Point Group Distribution

Analysis of 130,831 molecules from the QM9 dataset:

| Point Group | Count | Fraction | $R(G,N)$ |
|-------------|-------|----------|-----------|
| $C_1$ | 121,459 | 92.8% | 1.0 |
| $C_s$ | 7,248 | 5.5% | 1.0 |
| $C_{2v}$ | 1,683 | 1.3% | 1.0 |
| $C_{2h}$ | 289 | 0.2% | 1.0 |
| $D_{2h}$ | 74 | 0.06% | 1.0 |
| Other | 78 | 0.06% | 0.89–1.0 |

**99.9% of QM9 molecules have $R(G,N) = 1.0$** — all vibrational modes are observable via combined IR + Raman. The information-theoretic ceiling is effectively non-binding for typical organic molecules.

### Jacobian Rank Analysis

We computed the Jacobian $\partial \phi / \partial \mathbf{F}$ of the forward map for 999 randomly sampled QM9 molecular geometries:

- **100% had full rank** — the forward map is locally injective everywhere tested
- **Median condition number:** 6,474 (well-conditioned)
- **Mean overdetermination factor:** 4.1x (more spectral observables than force constant parameters)
- **Zero rank-deficient cases** out of 999 trials

This provides strong numerical evidence for the generic identifiability conjecture.

### Confusable Pair Analysis

Among pairs of molecules with similar IR spectra (cosine similarity > 0.95):

- **82.1%** are resolved by adding Raman information (similarity drops below 0.8)
- **12.4%** remain similar but distinguishable (similarity 0.8–0.95)
- **5.5%** are truly confusable — but these are predominantly structural isomers differing only in methyl group positions, where the vibrational differences are inherently small

## Implications for ML Architecture Design

The theoretical results directly inform the design of [Spektron](/projects/spektron):

1. **Dual-modality input:** Since IR and Raman are complementary for centrosymmetric molecules and partially complementary for all molecules, the model processes both modalities jointly via domain embeddings.

2. **VIB bottleneck dimension:** The $z_\text{chem}$ dimension (128) is chosen to exceed $3N - 6$ for the largest QM9 molecules ($N = 29$, giving 81 vibrational DOF), ensuring the bottleneck doesn't discard observable information.

3. **Testable predictions:**
   - Model accuracy should decrease monotonically with $R(G,N)$ — molecules with silent modes should be harder to identify
   - IR-only and Raman-only models should underperform the combined model, with the gap largest for centrosymmetric molecules
   - The confusable pair analysis predicts which molecule pairs the model will struggle with
