Normal modes are the fundamental vibrational patterns of a molecule. This tool lets you explore each mode visually and understand how molecular symmetry determines what spectroscopy can observe.

## What You'll Learn

- Each mode has a **frequency** (cm⁻¹), a **displacement vector**, and **symmetry labels**
- **Selection rules** determine whether a mode is IR-active, Raman-active, or silent
- For centrosymmetric molecules, IR and Raman modes are mutually exclusive

## Features

- Animate each mode independently or combined
- Symmetry labels and selection rules displayed
- Side-by-side comparison of different modes
- Energy distribution visualization
