Explore vibrational spectra interactively with SpectraView — a Canvas+SVG hybrid renderer built for scientific visualization.

<SpectraviewDemo client:idle />

## What You Can Do

- **Toggle sample spectra** — Load ethanol, acetone, or isopropanol IR spectra. Overlay multiple spectra for comparison.
- **Peak detection** — Enable automatic peak picking with adjustable prominence threshold.
- **Region highlights** — Visualize common functional group regions (C=O, C-H, O-H stretches).
- **Zoom and pan** — Mouse wheel to zoom, click-drag to pan, toolbar buttons for quick actions.
- **Theme switching** — Toggle between light and dark modes.

## Under the Hood

SpectraView renders spectral data using a dual-layer architecture:

- **Canvas 2D** for the spectral traces — handles 10,000+ data points at 60fps with min-max path decimation
- **SVG overlay** for axes, grid, crosshair, peak markers, and region highlights — interactive elements that benefit from DOM events

The reversed x-axis follows the IR spectroscopy convention (4000 → 400 cm⁻¹), and the zoom behavior preserves the scientific context of the data.

## Built With

- [spectraview](https://github.com/ktubhyam/spectraview) — React component library for spectral visualization
- [spectrakit](https://github.com/ktubhyam/spectrakit) — Python spectral data processing toolkit
