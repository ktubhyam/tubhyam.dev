VibeScope lets you explore molecular vibrations in 3D. Select a molecule from the library, choose a vibrational mode, and watch atoms oscillate in real time.

## How It Works

Molecular geometries and normal modes are pre-computed using quantum chemistry (B3LYP/def2-TZVP). The Wilson GF method gives eigenvalues (frequencies) and eigenvectors (displacement vectors). Three.js renders the molecule and animates atoms along displacement vectors.

## Features

- Interactive 3D molecule rendering
- Normal mode animation with adjustable amplitude and speed
- IR and Raman spectrum overlay with mode highlighting
- Molecule library with common organic and inorganic molecules
