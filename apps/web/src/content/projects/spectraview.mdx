SpectraView is a React component library purpose-built for rendering scientific spectral data. It combines a Canvas 2D layer for high-performance trace rendering with an SVG overlay for interactive elements like axes, crosshairs, and peak markers.

## Why a Custom Renderer

Standard charting libraries (Chart.js, Recharts, Victory) aren't built for spectroscopy. They struggle with:
- **Reversed x-axis** — IR convention runs 4000 → 400 cm$^{-1}$, left to right
- **10,000+ data points** — real spectra have thousands of points that need to render at 60fps
- **Domain-specific interactions** — zoom should preserve wavenumber context, not just pixel coordinates
- **Overlaid annotations** — functional group regions, peak markers, and comparison spectra need to coexist without performance cost

SpectraView handles all of these natively.

## Architecture

The renderer uses a dual-layer approach:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────┐
│  SVG Layer (top)                │  ← Axes, grid, crosshair, peak markers,
│  - DOM events + interactions    │     region highlights, annotations
│  - Resolution-independent       │
├─────────────────────────────────┤
│  Canvas 2D Layer (bottom)       │  ← Spectral traces, fill areas
│  - Min-max path decimation      │     10K+ points at 60fps
│  - Hardware-accelerated         │
└─────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Path decimation** is key to performance: when zoomed out, 10,000 points are reduced to ~2x the pixel width by keeping only the min and max intensity within each pixel column. This produces visually identical results at a fraction of the rendering cost.

## Features

- **Multi-spectrum overlay** — Load multiple spectra with distinct colors for comparison
- **Peak detection** — Automatic peak picking with adjustable prominence threshold
- **Region highlights** — Visualize functional group regions (C=O, C-H, O-H stretches) with labeled bands
- **Zoom and pan** — Mouse wheel zoom, click-drag pan, toolbar buttons for quick actions
- **Crosshair** — Real-time coordinate display as cursor moves over spectrum
- **Theme switching** — Light and dark mode support
- **Reversed x-axis** — Follows IR spectroscopy convention by default, configurable per instance
- **Responsive** — Auto-resizes with container via ResizeObserver

## Usage

```tsx
import { SpectraViewer } from "spectraview";

<SpectraViewer
  spectra={[
    { data: ethanolData, color: "#00D8FF", label: "Ethanol" },
    { data: acetoneData, color: "#C9A04A", label: "Acetone" },
  ]}
  xLabel="Wavenumber (cm⁻¹)"
  yLabel="Absorbance"
  reversed
  peaks={{ enabled: true, prominence: 0.05 }}
  regions={[
    { start: 2800, end: 3000, label: "C-H stretch", color: "rgba(0,216,255,0.1)" },
    { start: 1650, end: 1800, label: "C=O stretch", color: "rgba(201,160,74,0.1)" },
  ]}
/>
```
