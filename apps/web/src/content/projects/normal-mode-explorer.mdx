Normal Mode Explorer is an interactive tool for visualizing molecular vibrations in 3D. Select a molecule, pick a vibrational mode, and watch atoms oscillate along their displacement vectors in real time. Every mode comes with symmetry labels, selection rules, and spectral context.

## Why This Exists

Understanding normal modes is fundamental to vibrational spectroscopy — but textbooks show static arrow diagrams on flat pages. The connection between a peak on a spectrum and the actual atomic motion that produces it is hard to build intuitively from 2D drawings alone.

NME lets you see each mode animate, hear its frequency, compare modes side-by-side, and understand why symmetry determines what spectroscopy can observe.

## Features

### 3D Molecular Visualization
- Real-time animation of vibrational modes with adjustable speed and amplitude
- CPK-colored atoms with displacement arrows showing mode vectors
- Trajectory trails that trace atomic paths over time
- Symmetry element overlays (axes, planes, inversion center)
- Auto-rotating orbit camera with smooth damping
- Screenshot export and fullscreen mode

### Analysis Panels
- **Mode List** — All vibrational modes with frequency, symmetry label, IR/Raman activity badges
- **Spectrum Chart** — IR and Raman spectrum with the current mode highlighted
- **Selection Rules** — Why each mode is IR-active, Raman-active, or silent, derived from point group symmetry
- **Boltzmann Panel** — Temperature-dependent population distribution across modes
- **Energy Chart** — Vibrational energy level diagram
- **Displacement Table** — Per-atom displacement magnitudes for the selected mode
- **Sonification** — Hear the vibrational frequency mapped to audible range

### Interaction
- **Side-by-side comparison** — Compare two modes in split viewport (Shift+click or press B)
- **Superposition mode** — Combine multiple modes to see total vibrational motion (press S)
- **Keyboard shortcuts** — Arrow keys cycle modes, Space plays/pauses, Esc closes panels
- **Shareable URLs** — `nme.tubhyam.dev/?mol=ethanol&mode=3` links directly to a molecule and mode

## Molecule Library

45 molecules from diatomics (HCl, HF) to larger organics (benzene, glycine, isobutane). All geometries and normal modes computed using quantum chemistry (B3LYP/def2-TZVP via Psi4), giving eigenvalues (frequencies in cm$^{-1}$) and eigenvectors (displacement vectors).

Each molecule includes:
- Optimized 3D geometry with atomic masses
- All $3N - 6$ vibrational modes (or $3N - 5$ for linear molecules)
- IR intensities and Raman activities for every mode
- Point group and symmetry labels per mode
