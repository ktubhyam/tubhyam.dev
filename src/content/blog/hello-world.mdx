This is the first post on my new site. I built it with **Astro 5**, **Tailwind CSS 4**, and a glassmorphism design language that I'm calling "liquid glass."

## Why a Personal Site?

As a computational chemist and ML researcher, I spend most of my time writing code, running experiments, and reading papers. But I realized I needed a place to share my work publicly — not just on GitHub, but in a way that tells a story.

## What's Here

- **Simulations** — Interactive browser-based physics and chemistry simulations
- **Libraries** — Open-source Python packages for spectroscopy and molecular analysis
- **Research** — My papers and publications
- **Blog** — Technical writing on everything from group theory to neural networks

More to come. Stay tuned.
