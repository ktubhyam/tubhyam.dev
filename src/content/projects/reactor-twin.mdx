ReactorTwin creates fast, accurate surrogate models of chemical reactors that run 1000x faster than traditional CFD simulations while preserving physical constraints.

## Architecture

```
Process Data (T, P, C, F)
    → Feature Engineering (residence time, Da, Pe)
    → Neural ODE Encoder (physics-constrained)
    → Latent State z(t)
    → Decoder: concentration, temperature, conversion profiles
```

## Key Features

- **Neural ODE reactor models** — Learn reactor dynamics from process data
- **Physics-informed training** — Enforce mass balance, energy balance, thermodynamic constraints
- **Real-time dashboard** — Live visualization of reactor state with D3.js
- **What-if analysis** — Predict outcomes of operating condition changes
- **Anomaly detection** — Flag deviations from expected behavior
- **Multi-reactor support** — CSTR, PFR, batch, semi-batch

## Tech Stack

- PyTorch + torchdiffeq for neural ODEs
- Cantera for thermodynamics
- Next.js + D3.js for the monitoring dashboard
- FastAPI + Docker for model serving
