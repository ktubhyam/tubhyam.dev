SpectraKit is a Python library for working with vibrational spectroscopy data. It provides a unified `Spectrum` object that handles IR, Raman, and UV-Vis spectra with consistent preprocessing, visualization, and analysis tools.

## Features

- Multi-format I/O: JCAMP-DX, CSV, SPC, Bruker OPUS
- Preprocessing: baseline correction (ALS), smoothing (Savitzky-Golay), normalization (SNV, MSC)
- Peak detection and fitting
- Spectral matching and similarity scoring
- Publication-quality plotting
