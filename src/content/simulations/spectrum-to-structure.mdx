The inverse problem of spectroscopy: given a spectrum, what molecule produced it? This simulation uses the Spektron encoder to embed spectra into a chemical latent space and retrieve the most likely molecular candidates.

## How It Works

1. Upload, paste, or draw a spectrum (IR or Raman)
2. The Spektron encoder processes it through CNN tokenizer → Transformer → VIB head
3. The z_chem latent vector is compared against a molecular database
4. Top-k candidate structures are displayed in 3D with confidence scores
5. Conformal prediction provides calibrated uncertainty bounds

## Features

- Interactive spectrum drawing canvas
- Real-time ML inference (ONNX Runtime in browser)
- 3D molecular structure visualization
- Confidence scores and uncertainty quantification
