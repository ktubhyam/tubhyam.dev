Can you identify a molecule just from its spectrum? SpectraQuest turns the spectral inverse problem into a puzzle game with progressive difficulty, scoring, and achievements.

## Game Modes

- **Mystery Mode** — Analyze an unknown spectrum, match peaks to functional groups, eliminate candidates, and identify the molecule
- **Speed Round** — Rapid-fire peak identification under time pressure
- **Build Mode** — Construct a molecule to match a target spectrum by adding functional groups
- **Campaign** — 30+ levels from simple alcohols to complex natural products

## Features

- Interactive spectrum viewer with zoom, pan, and peak picking
- Functional group reference library with characteristic frequencies
- Scoring system: accuracy × speed × streak multiplier
- Achievements and progression unlocks
- Annotated solutions explaining every peak assignment
