Bridge the gap between abstract group theory and practical spectroscopy. See symmetry operations animate in 3D and understand why certain vibrational modes are observable while others are "silent."

## What You'll Learn

- **Why** CO2 has IR-active but Raman-inactive asymmetric stretch
- **How** the mutual exclusion principle works for centrosymmetric molecules
- **What happens** to selection rules as molecular symmetry changes

## Features

- 3D molecule viewer with symmetry element overlays (axes, planes, inversion center)
- Step-through animated symmetry operations
- Character table display with irreducible representations
- Selection rule calculator (IR, Raman, silent modes)
- Information Completeness Ratio R(G,N) visualization
- Point group identification flowchart
