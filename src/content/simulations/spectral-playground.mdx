A hands-on tool for learning spectral preprocessing. Upload a spectrum or use preloaded examples, then build a preprocessing pipeline by dragging and reordering steps.

## Features

- **Drag-and-drop** spectrum upload (JCAMP-DX, CSV)
- **Real-time** baseline correction (ALS, SNIP, polynomial)
- **Smoothing** (Savitzky-Golay, Whittaker)
- **Normalization** (SNV, min-max, area, vector)
- **Derivative** computation (1st, 2nd order)
- **Visual diff** — before/after overlay
- **Code export** — copy equivalent Python/SpectraKit code

All processing runs client-side in Web Workers — no server required.
