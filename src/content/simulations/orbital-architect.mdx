Build atoms from scratch. Place electrons into orbitals following real quantum mechanical rules — get it wrong and the atom destabilizes. Watch 3D orbital shapes materialize as you fill them.

## Game Modes

- **Campaign** — Build elements from hydrogen to krypton across 36 levels of increasing complexity
- **Challenge Mode** — Timed rounds: configure atoms as fast as possible for high scores
- **Sandbox** — Free exploration with no rules. Break Pauli exclusion and see what happens.

## Features

- 3D orbital visualizations (s, p, d shapes rendered in real-time)
- Drag-and-drop electron placement with quantum number feedback
- Energy level diagram that updates as you build
- Rule violation detection with educational explanations
- Scoring, streaks, and achievement system
- Periodic table integration
